This Coffee Shop Dashboard project aimed to revolutionize Maven Roaster's operational strategy through comprehensive data analysis and visualization. By leveraging transactional data spanning from January to June 2023, this project endeavored to provide invaluable insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends across three locations in New York City.

## Key Objectives:
- **Data Preparation and Profiling:** The initial phase involved meticulous data cleansing and profiling to ensure accuracy and reliability. Calculated fields such as revenue, month, day of the week, and hour of the day were added to facilitate in-depth analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis with Pivot Tables:** Excel PivotTables were employed to dissect the dataset and uncover meaningful patterns. Views were created to analyze revenue trends over months, transactions by day of the week and hour of the day, and transaction volumes by product category and type.
- **Dynamic Dashboard Development:** The culmination of the project was the development of an interactive dashboard that provided stakeholders with a user-friendly interface to explore and interpret the data. Pivot charts were strategically integrated to visualize revenue trends, transaction volumes, and product performance. A dynamic slicer enabled seamless filtering by store location, allowing for targeted analysis and decision-making.
  
## Key Insights and Recommendations:
- **Sales Growth:** Total revenue doubled over the first semester of 2023, indicating significant growth.
- **Peak Transaction Times:** 45% of transactions occur from 7 AM to 11 AM, highlighting the importance of morning service.
- **Morning Service Priority:** Ensuring high service levels during peak morning hours is critical for customer satisfaction and maximizing sales.
- **Evening Transaction Decline:** Transactions sharply decline after 7 PM, suggesting potential cost savings by adjusting late afternoon opening hours to minimize expenses like electricity, rent, and labor costs.
- **Product Performance:** Brewed Chai tea is the top-selling product by transaction quantity, while Barista Espresso leads in revenue generation among product types.
- **Coffee Dominance:** Coffee emerges as the top category, indicating its significance in driving sales and revenue.
